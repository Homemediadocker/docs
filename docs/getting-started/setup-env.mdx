# Env Setup

:::tip Note
Additional modification can be done in the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Homemediadocker/Home-Media-Docker/blob/main/docker-compose.yml), but most things are variablized for you in the .env file. Please read through these steps to configure for your host machine.
:::

- Do this to create your `.env` file:

```sh
cp .env-example .env
```

You will need to adjust the newly created `.env` file with values specific to your machine. These values are marked with a comment `#CHANGE_ME`

Literally everything in the docker compose file is variablized as much as possible.

```bash
## CONTAINER  DATA LOCATION
# This will place the container data in the current repo location.
# You can change this and all data will be placed in that location.
DEFAULT_CONTAINER_DATA_LOCATION="./.containers" # Change this if you want the data outside of this repo

## NORDVPN SPECIFIC VARIABLES
TOKEN=11111111111223123123123123asdba123 # This is specific to nord VPN - found in the account settings and generated by the user
PRIVATE_KEY=sdlfkabakjhslkdgjadlfkjasdfhaskdjhagsdg ##CHANGE ME - follow instructions to obtain the private key
NORD_TECHNOLOGY=NordLynx # NordLynx or OpenVPN
NORD_CONNECT_AREA=United_States # You can separate this by country and city too, but if you leave it blank it will just default to the recommended fastest server

## User Host Machine - unix machines can find this by doing `id <username>`
UID="111" ##CHANGE ME this is usually the user id on the host machine that will be running the docker compose command. But you can make this be a less privileged user and that is fine too
GID="111" ##CHANGE ME group id of the associated user(s) that may be running this. This is passed into the docker env so keep in mind that this will be the only one in there.
TIMEZONE="America/Chicago" ##CHANGE ME - Your timezone. This gets passed into basically every container.

## Samba
SMB_USER="samba" ##CHANGE ME If you are on Mac, this SMB user is what will be used to mount the network drives on your machine.
SMB_PASS="test" ##CHANGE ME If you are on Mac, this SMB password is what will be used to mount the network drives on your machine.

## unix machines can find this by doing `id <username>` for the desired user's id on that machine
SMB_UID="12312" ##CHANGE ME The user ID that has access to the smb shares
SMB_GID="123123" ##CHANGE ME the group ID that has access to the smb shares

## Network Paths
MOVIE_NETWORK_SHARE="//IP.IP.IP.IP/SHARENAME" ##CHANGE ME network share for movies content
TV_NETWORK_SHARE="//IP.IP.IP.IP/SHARENAME" ##CHANGE ME network share for tv content

## Local Paths
LOCAL_MOVIES_PATH="/Volumes/Movies" # #CHANGE ME - this is if you don't use the network shares in the dockerfile, and want to mount them on the host machine.
LOCAL_TV_PATH="/Volumes/Television" # #CHANGE ME - this is if you don't use the network shares in the dockerfile, and want to mount them on the host machine.
LOCAL_BOOKS_PATH="/Volumes/Books" #CHANGE_ME - this is if you don't use the network shares in the dockerfile, and want to mount them on the host machine.
LOCAL_DOWNLOADS_PATH="/Volumes/Downloads" # #CHANGE ME - this is if you don't use the network shares in the dockerfile, and want to mount them on the host machine. This is for transmission specifically.

## Jellyseerr
JELLYSEER_LOG_LEVEL="info" # change this to `debug` to show more logs.

## PLEX
PLEX_CLAIM=""
PLEX_VERSION="docker"

## Komga
KOMGA_LIBRARIES_SCAN_STARTUP="true"
KOMGA_JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx8g" ## 8 GB - this helps reduce times waiting for pages to process and reduces crashing
KOMGA_REMEMBERME_KEY="" #CHANGE ME - need to add this to be able to remember a login

## JACKETT - THIS IS PROBABLY NOT USED BUT HERE THEY ARE
JACKETT_RUN_OPTS=""
JACKETT_AUTO_UPDATE="true"

## Nord VPN Variables

### Private Key / TOKEN

:::info Important!
Token and subscription to NordVPN Is needed to use this.
[See here](https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/20286980309265-How-to-use-a-token-with-NordVPN-on-Linux) for configuring/retrieving your `TOKEN` in Linux.
:::
This is required to run Nord VPN. Without it, the vpn will not start up or be linked to an account.

### IP Configuration

```shell
VPN_DNS="8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4" #CHANGE_ME - this is google's DNS if that works for you
VPN_ALLOWED_IPS="0.0.0.0/0" #CHANGE_ME - this allows all IPs
VPN_NET_LOCAL="172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16" #CHANGE_ME if your network doesn't fit this schema
```

- The `VPN_ALLOWED_IPS` is just a filler - this allows all IPs to connect to your instance. Configure this with a proper subnet here with allowed hosts to connect.
- The `VPN_NET_LOCAL` - These are local IP Addresses. This should work for most home networks. This is a comma-separated list of IP addresses with allowed CIDR ranges.

## UID/GID

This is specific to your host machine's user ID and group ID. If you run on a Unix based system then you can find these values for a user by doing the following:

```bash
id <username>
```

## Local Shares (Recommended)

Mount the drives you want on your host machine and have them setup to connect on boot. Then reference those paths in your variables. Comment out what you don't need.

:::tip Pro Tip
Doing it this way vs the network route ensures that the network paths are connected via your host machine. Docker networking can be a pain, so local is recommended. However, if you want to use Samba shares, you can, just be prepared to change the docker-compose file a lot.

Using local also has way less headaches if you are unfamiliar with docker's volume setup.

Emby and Jellyfin can also do realtime monitoring, but they do not work with Network shares! If you mount the network share on your host machine and then make it local to the container, it doesn't know the difference! You can have realtime monitoring without having to deal with network shares in the docker container!
:::

These are examples using network shares mounted locally on my own Macbook setup:

```bash
## Local Paths
LOCAL_MOVIES_PATH="/Volumes/Movies" #CHANGE_ME
LOCAL_TV_PATH="/Volumes/Television" #CHANGE_ME
LOCAL_BOOKS_PATH="/Volumes/Books" #CHANGE_ME
LOCAL_DOWNLOADS_PATH="/Volumes/Downloads" #CHANGE_ME
```

## Samba

### SMB (Samba) Shares User and Pass

This is specifically for mounting network shares. If you do not need this (i.e. if the host machine mounts the drives before docker spins up) then you can comment them out.

### SMB UID and GID

This may or may not be the same as the UID and GID above. For that reason I have separated it into different variables (if you needed to have only readonly access for a user or something).

### Network Shares

These are the IP Addresses and share names related to the network shares that you would like to mount as SMB shares.

## Jellyseer

Change this to be either `jellyfin`, `emby`, or `plex`

```shell
JELLYSEER_TYPE="jellyfin" #CHANGE_ME - based on what you decide for media server
```

## Transmission

The username and password is here in the env file. Please do change this and document it.

```shell
## TRANSMISSION
TRANSMISSION_USER="transmission" #CHANGE_ME
TRANSMISSION_PASS="noissimsnart" #CHANGE_ME
```

## ZWave JS

If you decide to use ZWaveJS and Home Assistant, you will need to setup the USB dongle for the zwave network to function:

```shell
ZWAVE_STICK_DEVICE_PATH="" #CHANGE_ME
```
