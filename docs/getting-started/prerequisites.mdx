# Prerequisites

## Downloading Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux Desktop)

Download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for your architecture.

:::warning Linux Desktop Querks

Just note that certain Linux distros (like Ubuntu or Pop_OS!) ship with `snapd` preinstalled. This causes issues since snapd is docker-based. You may need to [completely remove docker](../troubleshooting.mdx#docker-errors-and-cant-ever-completely-come-up) (this link will show you different troubleshooting options). 

- snapd can be installed alongside docker, but it can cause issues with docker commands due to `apparmor` that comes with it. This is a security measure put in place with Ubuntu systems but it can cause the errors seen in the troubleshooting page above.
- Docker Desktop _may_ conflict with the internal `snapd` docker engine. So be wary of installing it from source, you may want to install it from `snapd` itself.

## Downloading for a Linux Server Host Machine (Ubuntu - Debian)

Since this could change, please see the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods) for the official installation steps to get back up and going. This will walk you through:

- Adding a new PPA repository for `apt` to install from
- Adding docker-ce and other utilities to the CLI in a server

After executing the install above, be sure to look at the [Post Installation Steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to execute docker commands as a non-root user without `sudo`
