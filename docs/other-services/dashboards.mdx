# Dashboards

There are many dashboard solutions out there and available for use. These two have been fairly easy to configure. If you ever want to see more, head on over to [/r/selfhosted](https://reddit.com/r/selfhosted) and someone always posts one of their dashboards.

## Dashy

:::info Information

Dashy ships pre-configured with the rest of the containers. It is already configure to hit every container with a Web UI once spun up.

- A starter Dashy configuration file is given in the base repo at [./dashy-config.yml](https://github.com/Homemediadocker/Home-Media-Docker/blob/main/dashy-config.yml)
- This will create the starter environment for Dashy and you can add/remove and change it as you see fit for your own use case.
- There is also an Editor in the UI that is very easy to work with that will save the yaml configuration.

- Just Dashy Commands

| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| Start    | `docker compose up dashy -d` |
| Shutdown | `docker compose down dashy`  |

- Once started, Dashy should be hit from this url:

## Heimdall! OPEN THE BIFROST

:::warning Heads up!

Heimdall Is behind a `heimdall` profile for docker `docker compose --profile heimdall up -d`. This is just a simple landing page configurator that allows users to build a landing page with their favorite links.

- This dashboard is **NOT** preconfigured out of the box.
