## Transmission

:::info Information

- Transmission is a download client. This should be paired with the [VPN](./vpn.mdx) setup in this project.
  - By default it goes through the VPN's docker network layer.
- It is mobile responsive but if you want an app for all of this, you can add Transmission as a client in this App on Android: [nzb360](https://nzb360.com/).
- This is cross platform, but achieves a similar result: [LunaSea](https://www.lunasea.app/)

### Transmission Example Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  transmission:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/transmission:latest
    container_name: transmission
    network_mode: service:vpn
    environment:
      - PUID=${UID}
      - PGID=${GID}
      - TZ=${TIMEZONE}
      # - TRANSMISSION_WEB_HOME= #optional -- set if you have a custom transmission ui
      - USER=${TRANSMISSION_USER} #optional
      - PASS=${TRANSMISSION_PASS} #optional
      - WHITELIST=${TRANSMISSION_WHITELIST} #optional
      - PEERPORT=${TRANSMISSION_PEERPORT} #optional
      - HOST_WHITELIST=${TRANSMISSION_HOST_WHITELIST} #optional
    volumes:
      - ${DEFAULT_CONTAINER_DATA_LOCATION}/Transmission:/config
      - ${LOCAL_DOWNLOADS_PATH}:/downloads
    # ports: ### Ports are not allowed when network_mode: is service:vpn
    #   - 9091:9091 # webui
    #   - 51413:51413 # for seed discovery - greatly improves performance even if not seeding
    #   - 51413:51413/udp
    restart: unless-stopped
    # depends_on:
    # - vpn
    # - prowlarr
    # - sonarr
    # - radarr
```

:::warning Heads Up!

There's a lot of commented lines in the above Transmission config. 

- `ports:` are not allowed to be configured if the `network_mode:` is set to pass through the VPN service (`service:vpn`)
  - Ports are instead configured on the `vpn` service itself
- `depends_on:` This is uncommented in the main docker-compose file, but if you wanted to spin this up standalone, you wouldn't need that. Making the Transmission service depend on the `vpn` and the web crawlers/radarr/sonarr is important so that they come up first.
