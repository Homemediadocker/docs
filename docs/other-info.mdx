## Trakt TV Lists Sync

[Trakt](https://trakt.tv) is a freemium service that houses a bunch of content. You can setup all these services with Trakt (in some way) and have it keep track of your Watch history, playstates, and collection information.

Trakt is super useful for something like adding a piece of content to your WatchList and then configuring something like Sonarr or Radarr (above) to pull in that information and watch for that content to become available.

**This is not required**, but it's something I have used for years and love the integration I get with my family able to also simply add something to a list.

[Create an account](https://trakt.tv/auth/join), it's free. Give it a try! It's a lot to consume off the bat, so it isn't required. But It is definitely useful if you lose the databases on your Sonarr/Radarr. You can just configure the watchlist to pull in the data and it'll seamlessly repopulate data.

## NVIDIA Setup on Linux (Debian) Based Systems with a docker container

I followed [this page](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) for the latest NVIDIA Container Toolkit instructions and installing. `nvidia-ctk` is a utility built to give nvidia graphics capabilities into containers seamlessly.

> Uninstalling nvidia drivers from your system can be done [like this](https://lunux.net/how-to-uninstall-nvidia-drivers-in-ubuntu/).

> A quick install of the nvidia drivers for Ubuntu 22.04 can be found [here](https://askubuntu.com/a/1456466)

`nvidia-ctk` should setup the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` or the `~/.config/docker/daemon.json` for you, but this is what my working config looks like for reference:

```json
{
  "default-runtime": "nvidia",
  "features": {
    "cdi": true
  },
  "runtimes": {
    "nvidia": {
      "args": [],
      "path": "nvidia-container-runtime"
    }
  }
}
```

Be sure to set the devices in your `docker-compose.yml` to be like this for the emby container to recognize them in the `nvidia-smi`

```yaml
devices:
  - /dev/nvidia-uvm:/dev/nvidia-uvm # Added nvidia devices here
  - /dev/nvidia-uvm-tools:/dev/nvidia-uvm-tools # Added nvidia devices here
  - /dev/nvidia-modeset:/dev/nvidia-modeset # Added nvidia devices here
  - /dev/nvidiactl:/dev/nvidiactl # Added nvidia devices here
  - /dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0 # Added nvidia devices here
  - /dev/nvidia1:/dev/nvidia1 # Added nvidia devices here (i have a 2nd GPU so i needed this too)
  - /dev/dri:/dev/dri # For VAAPI access, not necessarily for NVIDIA cards
```

### NVIDIA Quick Reference

If you ever lose your nvidia transcoding from emby, you can try a few things:

- Reboot the system. This will solve it 99% of the time
- Reinstall the NVIDIA Drivers from the web
- Reinstall the NVIDIA Drivers from the apt repository

```bash
sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-535 -y
# or install nvidia-driver-### where your number is the current version
```

- Run `nvidia-smi` (Output should be similar to below)

```bash
$ nvidia-smi

- Check for persistence: (if this is disabled or failed then this could be your issue)

```bash
sudo systemctl status nvidia-persistenced
```

### Failed to initialize NVML: Failed to Initialize in Docker

This error may occur inside of the emby docker container where it will not register `nvidia-smi` or any associated video cards. I reported this to `linuxserver.io` in their github as an issue here: [docker-emby:#41](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-emby/issues/97).

#### Error:

```bash
$ docker exec -it emby /bin/bash
root@5a15af76e670:/# nvidia-smi
Failed to initialize NVML: Unknown Error
```

### Solution

TLDR - solved this [in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/354974912613449730/1226289649530568725) for anyone that comes across this in google and wants to try this solution.

The container wouldn't initialize the `nvidia-smi` and any cards associated with it. So mapping the nvidia stuff directly (as seen [in the comment above](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-emby/issues/97#issuecomment-2041262711) in the docker command) is what ultimately solved it.

> --device=/dev/nvidia-uvm \

    --device=/dev/nvidia-uvm-tools \
    --device=/dev/nvidia-modeset \
    --device=/dev/nvidiactl \
    --device=/dev/nvidia0 \
    --device=/dev/nvidia1 \

In my docker compose it looks like this:

```yaml
