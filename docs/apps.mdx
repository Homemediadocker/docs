# Mobile Apps

There are many mobile apps that can be paired with the docker containers in this project to further enhance your experience. The support has gotten better on all platforms over the years, iOS was admittedly slower to adopt the app ecosystem to be able to interact with a self-hosted setup like this.

## Android

### NZB360 (Android Only)

Use this app to interface with literally anything in your setup. If there's not a built-in service available for the container, you can connect directly to it via the hostname or IP Address and configure a custom Link.

### LunaSea (Android)

This app is very similar to NZB360, offers a lot of the same features, and is cross platform on iOS and Android. So configuration will be near identical.

### Trakt.tv (Android)

Trakt.tv recently released an app of their own to interact with their website and it is very good.

> Use this to create watch lists and add things to your watch list. Sonarr/Radarr has a Functionality called List Sync that can pull in List Data from Trakt. This is truly where the automation happens and you don't have to search for anything.

### Portarius - Container Management

This is a very basic application to manage some small aspects of your containers. It's a good visual, you can stop/restart your containers and even view some logs.

### JuiceSSH - An SSH client for Android

This is one I have used for YEARS. It is a great SSH client and can help you do a lot of things with whatever host machine you are on if you need to get in via SSH. Having a Linux server running the containers has been wonderful being able to reboot or check for updates and troubleshoot on the go. Well worth it to pay for pro if you choose.

## iOS/iPadOS

### LunaSea (iOS)
